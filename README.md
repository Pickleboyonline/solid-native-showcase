# Solid Native Showcase App

This Goal of this repo is to create an app that uses the [Solid Native](https://github.com/Pickleboyonline/solid-native) framework.

It should feature a frontend and a backend. The backend will be powered by Deno. I also want it to have a custom module and use another repo that is a 
custom module.

I think the app will be a simple TODO app with the following functionality:
- Backend to manage account and TODO app
- Native module for storage.
